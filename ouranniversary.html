    <h1>Our Anniversary</h1>

They were happily together spending time with each other but unlike others these two weren‚Äôt spending so much time in real life because she was a day scholar and he was a hosteller. They had different class timings too, but somehow, whenever they were free, they would definitely meet. 

You know what? She cooks really well (that‚Äôs damn rightt!!!). He always used to ask her to make something for him but she didn't always have time.

Like most couples, they were hiding their story from their parents. One day during a video call, she was so casual at home ‚Äî without headphones. He was still a scared guy even though his parents were actually chill about love.

Life was going on like that. They talked on the phone *a lot*. His entire call log was filled with her name and his mother‚Äôs. (Bro really valued both of them like his two eyes ‚Äî sounds cringe, but it‚Äôs true.)

One day, his parents came to know about their story. They didn‚Äôt scold him ‚Äî they just told him to focus on his studies too while being in love.

---

They spent a very sweet amount of time together and every moment was special ‚Äî but some were *very* special.

On their first year anniversary, they planned to celebrate it outside. They left the college early that day. 

They matched their outfits ‚Äî unknowingly! That‚Äôs love. He wore the bag she gifted him and she was extra pretty that day. They walked, talked, laughed and boarded a bus to the city.

In the bus, something magical happened. She hugged his arm tightly and he was blushing all the time. Then they found a seat, and he held her hand firmly (her cute little fingers ü•π). Their eyes did most of the talking.

They reached the city, went to a mall, did some window shopping, grabbed snacks. She insisted he try churros from Taco Bell ‚Äî it was his first time. He loved it. So, now it‚Äôs proven ‚Äî her taste in food is always right.

Then they went to a private library only she knew about. It was a beautiful place. There, they met one of her best friends. After talking for a while, they wanted privacy, so the boy explored the library on his own.

He found some lovely books. Then she came to him again ‚Äî and hugged him tightly. For about a full minute.

He was stunned. Surprised. In love.

She fell for him even deeper in that moment.

It was one of the most special memories in their entire journey.
