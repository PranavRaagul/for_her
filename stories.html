    <h1>How it all started...</h1>
    <div class="story-text">
As usual, there is the same boy who is a little bit cute and a smart childish girl who is pretty as heaven. 

Now let's skip the part where they met and directly jump into the next part — don’t worry, their meeting is a special event so I won’t miss it and I will bring it in at the right time.

They fell in love with each other but didn’t confess it. They had many differences in everything. 

One fine day, that girl sent a reel to him. It was a romantic song in Hindi. The boy didn’t understand Hindi much, so he took help from his friends.

The song? It described how cute the boy is and how she’s falling in love with him.

He understood it. And he made a bold and romantic move — the best moment of his life 😄.

While they were chatting casually, the girl asked: “When did you get the most adrenaline rush in your life?” (Unrelated question, still...)

He replied: “The time when I’m going to propose youuuu.”

She said: “ohhh... wait what?? seriously?”

Then she asked: “So we’re not single anymore right?”

He replied: “yes yes 😭”

The next day, they had an exam. After that, she asked him to meet her in the library and introduced him to each of her close friends in her class. 

The boy was very, very happy. I mean *very* very much happy.

---

Just like I promised — here’s how they met for the first time. The gods’ plan.

Our boy was playing ‘run and catch’ with friends. One day, a friend’s friend came to watch. That’s when he first saw her.

She was so pretty — he was instantly smitten. But he didn’t rush into confessing.

She, on the other hand, wasn’t interested at first — but she was curious. He played the game differently, smartly — and that caught her attention.

They met again. Slowly started knowing each other. His friends teased him about her (in a sweet way).

One night, a friend asked: “Do you like her?”
He said: “Yessssss!!! But I don’t want to rush things. Let it go with the flow.”

The girl sent Instagram requests to everyone in his group — except him. He was worried.

But guess what? She hesitated because she thought *he* might not accept it.

Eventually, she sent him a request — and he jumped up and down with joy before accepting it.

---

That day, he was travelling home. And suddenly...

A message popped up: “Hi, do you text in English or Tamil?”

It was from her 💌

He replied: “Hello, I text in both but mostly Tamil.”

They started texting — from “how are you?” to “what are you doing now?”

 Waitttt i think I'm missing most of the part lets first complete the missing part

Then she asked: “Let’s do Spotify Blend.”

He didn’t know what that was. She sent a Spotify Blend Music link. They saw a 91% match. Spotify even said: “If you both are not together, then you should be.”

Then came a fun Q&A game. Around 10:30pm on 16th December 2022, she asked: “Do you read books?”

He said: “No, but I want to read *It Ends With Us*.”

She replied: “I have the PDF. If you want, I’ll send it to you. But how do I send it?”

He smiled — she was asking for his number 😄

He sent it.

She said: “Aahaa finally getting your number 😂”

That message made his day even more beautiful.
