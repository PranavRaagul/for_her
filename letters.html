     Your Birthday is coming soon samhitha and ik you will be celebrating your birthday with your close friends. One thing I know about you is that you want to be with people who tells why they love you instead of just giving gifts, so always be them and tell me if someone troubles you and please don't supress your emotion. I do hope you will be enjoying your birthday and I'm currently working something special for you birthday. I hope you will like it.

      Right now I'm in Meghalaya and it is raining heavily in the night and cold in the morning, a slight relieve from chills during afternoon and shorter evenings. I have took a lot of videos to show you how it is here and we should come here once to experience this fantastic place.

      You once told me, "All I ever wanted was to be understood." I think I failed you there. I see it now. I’m sorry for not listening the way I should have. I hear you now — even in the silence.

      The day I saw your short haircut and you looked absolutely pretty just like a hollywood star actress ( like scarlet johnsen ). You in your pretty yellow dress with the short hair and smiling everything was just perfect for you ( you were pretty even from far distance where i was noticing youu ).
